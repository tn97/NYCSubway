This application was created for the frequenters of New York City. It's always terrible to get into the city, only to realize that your train is delayed *or closed down* due to maintenance. This app hopes to solve that problem by allowing the user to see what trains are undergoing work and plan ahead of time as to what the course of action will be.

 This is a Full Stack Application that pulls information from multiple data sources. One issue was the readability of the data, as the formats varied greatly. Below you will find the packages used to parse through the data and display it on the webpage dynamically.
